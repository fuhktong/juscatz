juscatz - Cat Social Media App Development Checklist

JUSCATZ APP DEVELOPMENT CHECKLIST & CONSTRAINTS
TECHNOLOGY STACK - STRICT REQUIREMENTS:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript ONLY
Mobile wrapper: Capacitor ONLY
NO frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
NO build processes during development
NO npm run build requirements
Keep it simple like PHP development workflow

DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES:

Edit files directly and see changes immediately
Use plain web technologies that can be uploaded/modified easily
Focus on HTML structure, CSS styling, and vanilla JS functionality
Test in browser first, then wrap with Capacitor for mobile

CSS ORGANIZATION RULES
File Structure:

Each HTML file gets its own dedicated CSS file
Example: index.html → index.css, profile.html → profile.css

CSS Scope Requirements:

All CSS must be unique to its specific file
Use file-specific class names to prevent overlap
Prefix classes with the page name (e.g., home-, profile-, feed-)

Each file is completely self-contained
Better to duplicate some CSS than create conflicts

WHEN ASKING FOR HELP:
Always specify: "Use only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript with Capacitor. No frameworks, no build processes. 
Keep it simple and directly editable like PHP development."

REMIND ANY LLM:
"I want to keep this project simple - just HTML/CSS/JS files that I can edit directly, like working with PHP. 
Use Capacitor only for mobile app conversion. No complex frameworks or build systems."
